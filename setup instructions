Setup instructions
The AvDelphi feeder is a simple script that allows you to feed the AvDelphi ADS-B network from your own ADS-B receiver software. This script is designed for use on Linux systems. If you aren’t familiar with the Linux command line you may need help installing this software. Otherwise, follow the instructions below.

Installing
 
1. Download the feeder script by visiting https://www.avdelphi.com/downloads.html

  a. As shell-script file -> https://www.avdelphi.com/downloads/avdelphi_feeder.sh
  b. As ZIP file -> https://www.avdelphi.com/downloads/avdelphi_feeder.zip

2. Make sure you are running with elevated privileges – you may need to ‘su’

3. Install ‘nc’ – this is a pre-requisite. 

   sudo apt-get install netcat

4. Extract the zip file if necessary and then copy the .sh file into the directory of your choice. We suggest /usr/local/avdelphi

5. Change the file permissions so the file can run using 

    chmod +x avdelphi_feeder.sh

6. Edit the file and make any changes to “SOURCE=” required to correctly read your ADS-B source. The file contains information you need to do this. The defaults work with a default dump1090 install.

7. Ensure that your ADS-B software is running then type

  ./avdelphi_feeder.sh to start the feeder and test it

8. You should see the following:

  AvDelphi ADS-B feeder Version 1.01

Auto starting the script 
To start the feeder automatically when your Linux system starts enter:

update-rc.d /usr/local/avdelphi/avdelphi_feeder.sh defaults 100 

or use crontab...

Edit crontab with the command "crontab –e" and add this line

@reboot /usr/local/avdelphi/avdelphi_feeder.sh

Changing the path to the file if you put it somewhere else
